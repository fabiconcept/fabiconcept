## 👋 Favour Tochukwu Ajokubi

Full stack developer working across web, mobile, and blockchain. I like building things that feel simple on the surface and solid underneath. My work usually lives somewhere between clean engineering and quiet design.

## 🧩 What I do

* Web and backend development
* Mobile apps
